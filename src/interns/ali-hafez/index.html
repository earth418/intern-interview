      <p> So I'm a little young for these kinds of things, but I've always loved technology, computing, and programming. Well, it started out with science,
        moved on to mathematics, and eventually I found the computers around me just fascinating. I started to code, and I found myself falling in love with
        the problem solving and just the ability to create. </p>
      <p> I do it in my free time, I teach myself new concepts, I watch videos.... I can never get enough. So I really wanted to put myself in an environment
        with other passionate programmers like myself, so I can learn with them, and from them, and just geek out about this stuff with them. </p>
      <p> I love everything about programming -- I've learned a lot, and found I like software development, math-based programming, and graphics the most. 
        I've never really found myself purusing web development all that much, so I'd be excited to learn that -- or continue my previous interests, too.
        It barely even matters what I end up doing, because I just like to <i> make </i> things. But the best software, in my opinon, helps people, 
        and makes their lives easier.
